# Dark June

A minimal dark theme designed with soft, feminine colors, so hopefully you can focus on the code rather than getting distracted with too many bright colors.

It is inspired by the lovely [Dark Feminine Italics theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Charlotte.dark-feminine-italic).
